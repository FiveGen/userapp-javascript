UserApp API JavaScript Client
================================

Use this client library to gain full access to the UserApp API from your JavaScript application.

## How do I start?

2. Include `userapp.client.js` on your site.
3. Initialize UserApp by running `UserApp.initialize({appId:'YOUR APP ID'});`.

5. Enjoy!
